Genetic Code Converter
======================

A very simple program for finding complimentary DNA pairs, mRNA code, and proteins coded for by mRNA. I realize that similar programs may exist, and this program was created for my own use, not to compete with them.

This program is released under the GPL v3 license, so you can basically do whatever you want with it as long as you don't restrict others' ability to view and modify the source code.
